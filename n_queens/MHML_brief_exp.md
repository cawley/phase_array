### Particle Swarm Optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality, or fitness function. Each particle, or potential solution, "flies" through the multidimensional search space with a velocity that is dynamically adjusted according to its own and the swarm's best known position. The velocity update uses three components: inertia (which maintains the particle's current direction), cognitive (which draws the particle towards its own best position), and social (which pulls the particle towards the best global or local position found by the swarm). These components are influenced by certain coefficients: the inertia weight controls the impact of the previous velocity, while the cognitive and social coefficients regulate the influence of the personal best and global best solutions respectively. By balancing exploration (searching new areas) and exploitation (refining current promising areas), PSO aims to find a global optimum in the search space.

### Simulated Annealing
Simulated Annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique used for finding an approximate global optimum of a given function. It starts from a random solution and then explores the neighborhood of the current solution, accepting changes that improve the objective function but also, crucially, some changes that don't. This helps to avoid getting trapped in local optima. The probability of accepting non-improving changes decreases over time, a process controlled by a parameter known as the "temperature," which starts high and is gradually reduced - hence the term "annealing." The rate at which the temperature decreases, known as the cooling schedule, is a key factor in the algorithm's performance and must be carefully chosen.

### Quantum Annealing
Quantum annealing is a metaheuristic for finding the global minimum of a given objective function over a given set of candidate solutions, primarily used for problems where the search space is discrete with many local minima. This technique uses principles from quantum physics, such as superposition (the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at once) and tunneling (the ability to pass through barriers), to escape local minima and find the global minimum. It starts with a superposition of all possible states (solutions) and evolves the system by gradually reducing the quantum effects. The coefficients in the problem Hamiltonian (a function describing the system's energy) represent the problem constraints and structure, and the annealing schedule (rate of reduction of quantum effects) significantly affects the performance of the optimization. This technique is particularly suited for optimization tasks implemented on quantum computers or quantum annealing devices.

### Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection. They start with a population of randomly generated potential solutions, or "individuals", each represented typically by a binary string. GAs iteratively select individuals for reproduction based on a fitness function, and apply genetic operators such as crossover (recombining parts of two parents to create offspring) and mutation (randomly altering parts of an individual). The probabilities of these genetic operators occurring are controlled by coefficients known as the crossover rate and mutation rate. The algorithm repeats these steps until a termination condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or achieving a satisfactory fitness level.

### Steepest Ascent Random Restart
The Steepest Ascent Random Restart optimizer is a variation of the Hill-Climbing algorithm, where the objective is to find the maximum (or minimum) of a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest ascent (or descent). Starting from a random point, the algorithm evaluates neighboring points in the search space and moves to the steepest uphill neighbor, repeating this process until no higher neighbor is found, indicating a local maximum. If this maximum isn't satisfactory or if the algorithm gets stuck at a plateau or ridge, it restarts from a new randomly chosen point, hence the term "random restart". This allows the algorithm to escape local optima and explore more of the search space for potential global optima. There are no explicit coefficients in the basic algorithm, but the number of restarts and the definition of neighborhood (which can be influenced by parameters) can greatly impact its performance.
