This problem can be formulated as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. Here, an agent (our calibrator) learns to interact with an environment (the beamformers) to maximize a cumulative reward (beam amplitude). This environment is non-deterministic, as the phase shifter and attenuator positions will depend on the particular system state at a given moment.

Here's how you could approach this:

Formulate the Problem: In reinforcement learning, an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing certain actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. The goal is to learn a policy, which instructs the agent on the best action to take in each state, to maximize its cumulative reward.

States: The states would represent the current system state of each AWS-0103, which are represented by the binary files.
Actions: The actions would be the possible adjustments to the phase shifter position, gain, and attenuation values. These could be discrete actions or a continuous action space, depending on the problem's requirements.
Rewards: The reward would be based on the amplitude of the beam. The larger the amplitude after an action, the higher the reward.
Model the Problem: Use a deep Q-network (DQN) or other suitable RL algorithms. A DQN combines Q-Learning (a commonly used RL technique) with deep neural networks to estimate the Q-values (the expected reward for each action in each state). The neural network would be trained to predict the Q-value of each action-state pair. The network would have the current state of the AWS-0103 as input and the Q-value of all possible actions as output.

Improve the Performance Over Time: Reinforcement Learning inherently improves over time as the agent explores the environment and exploits learned knowledge. You can further optimize this by using techniques like Experience Replay and Double DQN:

 - Experience Replay: The agent stores its experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a memory called the replay buffer. During training, the agent samples experiences from this buffer to update its Q-value estimates. This provides a more stable learning process.

 - Double DQN: In a standard DQN, the same network is used to select and evaluate an action, leading to overoptimistic Q-value estimates. The Double DQN uses two networks to separate these roles, reducing overestimations and improving stability.

Adaptive Learning Rate: Another technique for improving performance over time is using an adaptive learning rate for your neural network. This allows the network to learn quickly in the early stages, then more slowly as it starts to converge on an optimal policy.

Remember, RL can take a significant amount of time to converge to an optimal solution due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Exploration allows the agent to discover the best actions by trying out new actions, while exploitation uses the currently known best actions. Balancing this trade-off is key to effective learning.

Lastly, it's essential to note that this is an iterative process. After designing and training your initial model, you should evaluate its performance, adjust your approach as necessary, and retrain. This will likely involve tuning various parameters, such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate, and potentially experimenting with different RL algorithms or neural network architectures.
