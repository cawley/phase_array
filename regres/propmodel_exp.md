Initialize Parameters: This step is a bit like setting the initial positions for all the players on a soccer field before the game starts. Each player (or "parameter") has an important role in the game (the "prediction task"), and their initial positions could affect the outcome of the game. The function initialize_parameters() is responsible for setting these starting positions.

Forward Propagation: This is where the model makes its prediction. It's a bit like seeing how the play unfolds after the whistle blows. The ball is passed between players (data flows between parameters), with each player influencing the trajectory of the ball (each parameter affects the final prediction) based on their position and strategy. The function forward_propagation() manages this process.

Compute Cost: After the prediction is made, we need to assess how well the model did. This is done by comparing the model's prediction to the true answer, and calculating a 'cost' or 'loss'. The lower the cost, the better the model's prediction. It's a bit like a referee judging the quality of the play. The function compute_cost() calculates this cost.

Backward Propagation: Based on the cost, the model identifies how each player could have played better. It determines how each player (parameter) should change their strategy (adjust their values) to make a better play next time. This is done through a process called "backpropagation", handled by the backward_propagation() function.

Update Parameters: Here the players (parameters) adjust their strategies based on the feedback from the backpropagation step. They make small changes to their strategies (parameter values are updated) in hopes of performing better in the next play. This step is handled by update_parameters_with_adam().

Iterate: The model repeats this process many, many times (each iteration is a bit like a new game). Each time, the players get a little better at their game, and the model's predictions become a little more accurate.
