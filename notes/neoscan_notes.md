## Chapter 1
### Polarizer and Analyzer: When we pass a beam of light through two polarizing elements one after the other, the first one is called the Polarizer and the second one is the Analyzer. These elements affect the light's intensity based on their respective transmission axis angles. In other words, these two elements work together to control the amount of light that gets through based on how they're aligned with each other.

### s and p Polarization: The way light waves oscillate can be described as either s-Polarization or p-Polarization. In s-Polarization, the oscillation happens in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the light, like waves rippling out from a pebble thrown into a pond. In p-Polarization, the oscillation happens in a plane parallel to the direction of the light, like waves moving along a slinky toy.

### Finding the Polarization Axis: To find out the direction in which a polarizer (a tool used to create polarized light) is polarizing light, you can either pair it with a polarizer of known axis and rotate the unknown one until no light passes through, or take advantage of the Brewster effect, which involves looking at reflections off non-metallic surfaces.

### Circular Polarization: Light can also be polarized in a circular pattern. This happens when the light's electric field forms a circular pattern due to the components being equal in amplitude but 90° out of phase. This can be achieved by introducing a quarter-wave plate, which produces a delay between the orthogonal components of the wave, creating circularly polarized light.

### Superposition of Polarized Waves: When you combine two linearly polarized light waves that are in phase (oscillating together), they result in a new linearly polarized wave. The new wave has a different plane of polarization.

Light and Material Interaction: When light (which is an electromagnetic wave) passes through a material, it applies a force on the electrons that are loosely bound in the outer shell of atoms (called valence electrons). This interaction causes the charges to separate periodically, creating a local arrangement of tiny magnets, called dipoles.

### Polarization and Isotropic Materials: The separation of charges leads to a phenomenon known as polarization, which is aligned and directly related to the applied field. This is particularly true for materials known as linear isotropic materials, where the internal charges respond the same way no matter the direction of the applied electric field.

### Anisotropic Materials and their Properties: There are some materials, however, where the response isn't the same in all directions - these are called anisotropic materials. This comes from the lack of symmetry in the molecules making up the material. For example, some crystals might have strong connections in one direction, but weaker ones in another, causing the material to respond differently depending on the direction of the electric field.

### Crystal Structures: There are seven basic types of crystal structures (cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, trigonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic or triclinic) that are determined by the shape of the molecules in the material. These structures affect the way light interacts with the material.

### Impact on Light Speed: As light passes through a material, its speed slows down due to the interactions with the charges. If a material's structure is anisotropic (different in different directions), the speed of light will vary depending on the direction, due to the material's varying response.

### Refractive Index and Anisotropy: The measure of how much the speed of light changes in a material is called the refractive index. If the structure of a material is anisotropic, then the refractive index (and thus the speed of light) will also be different in different directions.

### Complex Crystals: For more complex crystals, the direction of polarization can be different from the direction of the applied field, and there may be different constants of proportionality (indicating how much polarization occurs) for different directions.

### Light Propagation: Light travels through transparent substances by exciting the atoms within the medium, causing the electrons to reradiate. The refractive index (how much the light is slowed down) depends on the difference between the frequency of the electromagnetic field and the natural frequency of the atoms.

### Optical indicatrix (Index Ellipsoid): This is a mathematical tool that helps us understand how light travels through certain materials. It's essentially a 3D shape that reveals how different light rays bend or slow down when they enter these materials. This is important for the design of optical devices such as lenses and polarizers.

### Symmetric dielectric tensor: This is a mathematical description of a material's property. It's a kind of 'matrix' (think of a table with rows and columns of numbers), which is 'symmetric' (its values are mirrored along a diagonal). It helps us predict how light interacts with the material.

### Anisotropic and isotropic materials: Anisotropic materials have properties that vary depending on the direction light is coming from. Isotropic materials, on the other hand, behave the same way no matter what direction light is coming from. An example provided is a birefringent dielectric. Birefringence is a property of a material that splits a ray of light into two rays, each taking a different path through the material.

### Basis of principal refractive indices: The x-, y-, and z-intercepts of the index ellipsoid match the principal refractive indices (which tell us how much the path of light is bent when entering a material). Therefore, these indices can be seen as measures of how much light is slowed down in the x, y, and z directions respectively.

### Uniaxial birefringence and Index ellipsoid: In certain materials where two of the principal refractive indices are equal (called uniaxial birefringent materials), the index ellipsoid has a cylindrical shape around the z-axis. In such a case, the speed of light waves depends on the refractive index the wave "sees," which is given by the index ellipsoid. This is important in the study of certain types of crystals.

### Ordinary and Extraordinary rays: In uniaxial birefringent materials, we have two primary types of light rays: ordinary rays (with refractive index no) and extraordinary rays (with refractive index ne). The direction of propagation and the intersection with the index ellipsoid can determine the direction and refractive index of these rays.

### The use of the Index Ellipsoid: It's used to find the direction and magnitude of the D vector (electric displacement field vector, a measure of how an electric field influences a material). Given the direction of a light ray, we can draw a plane at right angles to it. The point where this plane intersects the index ellipsoid gives an ellipse, and the principal axes of this ellipse give the directions of the D vectors. The lengths of the semi-minor and semi-major axes give the indices of refraction along these directions.

### Decomposition of the Extraordinary ray: The extraordinary ray's refractive index can change based on the direction of propagation in relation to the optic axis (an imaginary line that defines the optical behavior of the crystal). The angle this ray makes with the optic axis can be used to calculate the shape of the index ellipse, which gives us more details about how light is interacting with the crystal.

### Electromagnetic (EM) Waves and Fields: In the manual, EM waves are being analyzed, characterized by different parameters like E (electric field), D (electric field displacement), H (magnetic field), B (magnetic flux density), and k (wavevector). These parameters are related to each other and to the speed and direction of the waves.

### Anisotropic Medium: The behavior of these waves can change based on the material they're traveling through. Some materials, called "anisotropic," react differently depending on the direction of the wave. This is like how a piece of wood is easier to split along its grain rather than against it.

### Birefringence and Refractive Indices: A phenomenon called "birefringence" happens when a wave experiences different refractive indices in an anisotropic material. Refractive index is a measure of how much a ray of light is bent (or refracted) when moving from one medium to another. In simple terms, it's like entering a swimming pool at an angle; your legs seem to "bend" because light travels at different speeds in air and water.

### Ordinary and Extraordinary Waves: When a wave enters an anisotropic material, it splits into two waves: the "ordinary" and the "extraordinary" wave. The ordinary wave isn't deflected (its path doesn't change), while the extraordinary wave is deflected.

### Optical Axis and Polarization: In a specific material, there's a special direction known as the "optical axis." Light traveling along this axis, regardless of its polarization (the direction in which the light oscillates), will move together. The polarization can affect how the light behaves, especially in anisotropic materials.

### Energy Flow and Propagation Direction: The direction of energy flow (the Poynting vector) and wavefront direction can diverge in an anisotropic medium. This means the energy of the wave doesn't always travel in the same direction as the wave itself, creating a "double image" effect.

### Index Ellipsoid or Optical Indicatrix: This is a mathematical model that describes how light propagates in a birefringent material (a material that splits light into an ordinary and an extraordinary wave). It's called an "ellipsoid" because the model looks like a three-dimensional oval shape, which is used to figure out the paths of the split waves in the material.

### Uniaxial Birefringence: In some materials, there's only one direction (the "optic axis") that's special. In these, there are two primary refractive indices - one for the ordinary ray, and another for the extraordinary ray. These indices define how much each wave is refracted, or bent, within the material.

### Index Ellipsoid Use: By using the index ellipsoid, you can find the directions and refractive indices for the ordinary and extraordinary rays. This is achieved by drawing a plane normal (at a right angle) to the direction of the ray's propagation, which intersects the index ellipsoid. This gives an ellipse that provides the information for the waves' polarization and refractive indices.

### Fast and Slow Axis: Just like a filter lets only certain things through (think of a coffee filter allowing liquid through but not grounds), a linear polarizer lets certain types of light through. Light travels as waves, and these waves can have different orientations. A polarizer only allows waves with a certain orientation to pass. In a special kind of optical material called a wave plate, light can travel along two axes, known as the fast and slow axes. As their names suggest, light along the fast axis travels slightly faster than light along the slow axis, causing the light waves along these axes to become out of sync with each other. Depending on the type of crystal, the fast and slow axes can correspond to different properties of the light waves.

### 1/4-Wave Plate (Quarter-Wave Plate): This is a special type of wave plate used to change the way light is polarized. Polarization is a property of light that describes the direction in which the light waves are oscillating. A quarter-wave plate can change light from linear polarization (where the light waves oscillate in a line) to circular polarization (where the light waves oscillate in a circle), or vice versa. To do this, the quarter-wave plate slows down one component of the light wave just enough so that it becomes a quarter of a wave behind the other component.

### 1/2-Wave Plate (Half-Wave Plate): This is another type of wave plate, which flips the polarization of light. This means if light was oscillating in one direction, after passing through the half-wave plate, it will oscillate in the exact opposite direction. It's like looking at the light wave in a mirror. This is useful when you want to rotate the polarization of light to a certain angle.

### Birefringent Plate between Parallel Polarizers: A birefringent plate is a piece of material that splits light into two rays traveling at different speeds. If you place a birefringent plate between two polarizers that are lined up in the same direction, and turn the plate to a 45-degree angle, you'll get a beam of light that has some interesting properties. It's a bit like passing a group of runners through a narrow gate, with the runners being the light and the gate being the polarizers.

### Birefringent Plate between Crossed Polarizers: The setup is similar to the previous point, but this time the polarizers are crossed, meaning they're at right angles to each other. Now, the "gate" the "runners" have to pass through is even narrower.

### Rotating the Analyzer: Here, we're adjusting the analyzer, which is a special kind of polarizer, to be at an angle with the original polarizer. This creates a situation where the polarizers are neither parallel nor crossed, and the birefringent plate is again at a 45-degree angle. This changes the characteristics of the light that passes through.

### Finding the Fast and Slow Axes of a Retarder: This is like finding the best path for the runners in our race. By placing the retarder (another device that changes light properties) between two crossed polarizers and turning it until the most light gets through, you can identify the fast and slow axes. The fast axis is the direction the "fastest runners" take, and the slow axis is the direction for the "slowest runners". You can also identify which axis is which by checking how the color of the light changes as you rotate the retarder.

### Determining a 1/4 Wave Retarder from a 1/2 Wave Retarder: These are two types of retarders that change the light in different ways. A 1/4 wave retarder turns linearly polarized light (light vibrating in a line) into circularly polarized light (light vibrating in a circle), and a 1/2 wave retarder changes the angle of linearly polarized light. You can figure out which type of retarder you have by seeing how the light changes when you shine it through the retarder and into an analyzer. If the brightness of the light changes as you turn the analyzer, you have a 1/2 wave retarder. If the brightness stays the same, it's a 1/4 wave retarder.
