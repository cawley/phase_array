## Phased Array Calibrator üì°

This Python repository focuses on creating a calibrator application that optimizes the amplitude of a [phased array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array#:~:text=In%20antenna%20theory%2C%20a%20phased,directions%20without%20moving%20the%20antennas) by adjusting the phase shift and attenuator positions of [Anokiwave AWS-0103](https://www.anokiwave.com/products/aws-0103/index.html) beamformers. The calibrator accepts binary files representing the system state of each AWS-0103 alters phase shifter position, gain and attenuation values to calibrate each beamformer, and consequently the phased array beam, in a user-defined configuration. These two papers provide a [simple overview](https://web2.norsonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TN-beamformers.pdf) and a more [in-depth look](https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/8.923310) at beamformers and how they are calibrated.

### Hot Tip: [/bin](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/tree/main/bin) and [/n_queens](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/tree/main/n_queens) provide an easy and intuitive explanation of this project geared towards the layperson.
 
## Our Approaches üñãÔ∏è

 - [Memoryless Machine Learning](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/tree/main/n_queens)
   - Metaheuristic algorithms (GA, PSO, SARR, QA) take inspriation from natural phenomena to optimize poorly defined functions for which traditional derivatives are not applicable.
 - [Weighted and Cached Machine Learning](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/tree/main/bin)
   - Memory, multithreading, encodings, caching and other optimization strategies built on to each metaheuristic algorithm to help scale up to large-N input size.
 - [Linear Model Approach](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/tree/main/works_in_progress/xgb)
   - Linear learning models like XGB, RFR and GBM proved not to have the complexity necessary to accurately model these nonlinear systems.
   - We also tried an [autoencoder](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/blob/main/works_in_progress/vae/simple_vae.py) that follows xÃÑ = ùïåùïçx 
 - [Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/tree/main/works_in_progress/reinforcement_learning)
   - Reinforcement learning models create a set of actions ùíú called an Agent, and create an optimal strategy called a policy ùìü based on a reward system ùïº.
 - [Nonlinear Output Prediction via Convolutional Neural Net](https://github.com/cawley/phase_array/tree/main/conv_net)
   - Here, we encode the state of the phased array as an image where each cell is a pixel and apply the calculated optimal improvements to the image based on historical data as well as expert system analysis.
  
## Common Approaches :pencil2:

 - [Maximum likelihood beamformer](https://sci-hub.se/10.23919/EUSIPCO.2019.8902753)
   - This approach models noise as a stationary Gaussian white random process and the signal waveform as deterministic and unknown. 
- [Bartlett beamformer](https://sci-hub.se/10.4314/njt.v36i4.23)
  - The Bartlett beamformer extends conventional spectral analysis to the Directional Arrival Assessment (DAA). The angle that maximizes the spectral power is used to estimate the angle of arrival. 
- [Capon beamformer](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA433961.pdf)
  - Also known as the minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming algorithm, the Capon beamformer offers better resolution than the Bartlett approach. However, it has higher complexity due to the need for full-rank matrix inversion. Recent advances in GPU computing have made real-time Capon beamforming more feasible. 
- [MUSIC beamformer](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/IBCAST.2014.6778172)
  - The MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) beamforming algorithm starts by decomposing the covariance matrix for both the signal and noise parts. It uses the noise sub-space of the spatial covariance matrix in the denominator of the Capon algorithm, thus known as subspace           beamformer. This approach provides better Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation compared to the Capon beamformer. The ESPRIT algorithm can be used as an alternative approach.
- [Artificial Intelligence](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/MAP.2020.3036097)
  - The ongoing trend in digital signal processing for DAA involves the use of Artificial Intelligence technologies.

## Problem Statement üìì

Given the complex and multidimensional nature of our problem, we don't have a well-defined function relating the beamformer wave magnitude to the phase shifter and attenuator values. As a result, we use metaheuristic algorithms to search the solution space for an optimal solution efficiently. 

To evaluate the performance of these metaheuristic algorithms, we demonstrate their effectiveness on the classic NP-hard NQueens problem because of its multidimensional and computationally heavy nature. We use several different metaheuristics (Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing, Steepest Ascent Random Restart, and Quantum Annealing) and rate them based on their calls to the fitness function and convergence to the optimal solution.

## Solution Approach üë©‚Äçüî¨

The main bottleneck in our problem is the calls to the fitness function because each call requires us to loop through the entire system: from the beamformer to grab the state, through the Software Defined Radio (SDR) to digitize the signal, and then back to the Python program to rate its efficacy. 

The bin folder contains our work on a closer representation of the real problem. Here, we take a 16x16 string of 6-bit integers and optimize it to the optimal state, which is a randomly generated 16x16 string of 6-bit integers.
